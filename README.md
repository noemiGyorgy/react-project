This web application provides you with some information about The Lord of the Rings franchise. You can learn about the books, movies and the characters, also you can change the theme from light to dark.

We wanted to build this application to practice React. Because we are fans of the franchise, we chose [The Lord of the Rings open API](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation) to work with.

## Important!

Access for the LOTR API users to all endpoints is limited to 100 requests every 10 minutes. This may cause some issues for our app in some edge cases.

## Technical Goals

Practicing:

- React
- React hooks
- Styled components
- React context API
- CSS usage
